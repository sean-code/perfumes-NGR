This project is a Node.js application that utilizes the Prisma ORM to interact with a MySQL database. It serves as a foundation for managing and retrieving data related to users and perfumes. The project includes a script for seeding the database with sample user and perfume data, providing a starting point for development.

Key Features:

Database Seeding: The included database seeding script populates the MySQL database with sample user and perfume data, enabling you to quickly get started with your project.

User Management: The application includes routes for finding all users and individual users by their UUID IDs.

Perfume Management: It offers various routes for managing and retrieving perfume data, including CRUD actions (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and filtering perfumes by category, color, price range, and rating.

Express.js Web Server: The application is built using Express.js, providing a web server for handling API requests.

Prisma ORM: Prisma is used as the ORM to interact with the MySQL database, making it easy to work with your data models.

This project provides a solid foundation for building a web application that manages user and perfume data. You can easily extend and customize it to suit your specific requirements.
